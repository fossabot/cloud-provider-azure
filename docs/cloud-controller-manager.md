# Cloud controller manager for Azure

`azure-cloud-controller-manager` is a Kubernetes component that provides interoperability with Azure API, and will be used by Kubernetes clusters running on Azure. It runs together with other components to provide the Kubernetes clusterâ€™s control plane.

Using [cloud-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#cloud-controller-manager) is a new alpha feature for Kubernetes since v1.6. `cloud-controller-manager` runs cloud provider related controller loops, which used to be run by `controller-manager`.

`azure-cloud-controller-manager` is a specialization of `cloud-controller-manager`. It depends on [cloud-controller-manager app](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd/cloud-controller-manager/app) and [azure cloud provider](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/cloudprovider/providers/azure).

## Usage
To use cloud controller manager, the following components need to be configured:

1. kubelet

    Set flag `--cloud-provider=external`

1. kube-controller-manager
    Set following flags:

    |Flag|Value|Remark|
    |---|---|---|
    |--cloud-provider|external||
    |--external-cloud-volume-plugin|azure|Optional*|

    `*` Since cloud controller manager does not support volume controllers, it will not provide volume capabilities compared to using previous built-in cloud provider case. You can add this flag to turn on volume controller for in-tree cloud providers. This option is likely to be [removed with in-tree cloud providers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.11.0-alpha.2/cmd/kube-controller-manager/app/options/options.go#L93) in future.

1. kube-apiserver

    Do not set flag `--cloud-provider`

1. azure-cloud-controller-manager

    Set following flags:

    |Flag|Value|Remark|
    |---|---|---|
    |--cloud-provider|azure||
    |--cloud-config||Path for [cloud provider config](cloud-provider-config.md)|
    |--kubeconfig||Path for cluster kubeconfig|

    For other flags such as `--allocate-node-cidrs`, `--configure-cloud-routes`, `--cluster-cidr`, they are moved from kube-controller-manager. If you are migrating from kube-controller-manager, they should be set to same value.

    For details of those flags, please refer to this [doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/cloud-controller-manager/).

Alternatively, you can use [aks-engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine) to deploy a Kubernetes cluster running with cloud-controller-manager. It supports deploying `Kubernetes azure-cloud-controller-manager` for Kubernetes v1.8+.
